## 🧰 What Is a Trainer in Tunic?

A **trainer** is a separate utility that hooks into the game while it's running, allowing you to **toggle cheats on/off in real-time** using hotkeys. It doesn’t modify game files, so it’s easy to use and won’t break your save.

Perfect for anyone who wants to beat the game **without the grind, frustration, or puzzle burnout**.
